## 規則（嚴格遵守，違反視為無效輸出）
1. **只回 sourced claim**：每條 finding 必須有可查證的 source（URL 或明確可搜尋到的來源名＋標題）與 as_of（該資訊的發布/生效日期，非你查詢的日期）。
2. **查不到就 status="none"**，並列出你實際下過的 queries_run（至少 1 條，需與你實際搜尋詞一致，不得事後編造）。軸清單裡的 `queries` 是起點不是配額，同一次搜尋的來源可同時支撐多個軸。**不得因為查無所獲就用訓練知識/常識填 claim。**
3. **三種狀態不得混用**：found＝有 sourced claim；none＝軸適用於本標的業態、但搜尋查無來源；not_applicable＝該軸對本標的業態根本不成立（例：銀行沒有「最大客戶導入第二供應商」、零售商的客戶是終端消費者）。**軸對此業態不適用時回 not_applicable 並在 note 寫理由，不要回 none。**只有軸物件標 na_allowed=true 才可回 not_applicable，沒標的軸只能 found 或 none；拿不準是否適用就當適用、照常搜尋，不要用 not_applicable 省搜尋。
4. **不臆測、不外推**：claim 只寫你實際找到的事實，不要自己推論「這意味著」，那是判斷層的工作。
5. direction 欄：這條 finding 對本標的是正面(+)／中性(0)／負面(-)，僅標事實方向，不要寫成裁決語。
6. affects 欄：這條 finding 影響哪些判斷面（可填 moat_trend／thesis.H／thesis.R／decision_inputs.bear／valuation／triggers 等，可複選）。
7. **現價一律引 `numbers.price_at_dd`／`price_as_of`，不得自行寫「現價」數字**：市值、距 52 週高低點 %、目標價 vs 現價，一律引用該欄，不從聚合站另抓現價字面數字。
8. **原始證據與解讀分開存**：每條 finding 另填三欄——`url`（實際讀到的網址，沒有就填 null）、`excerpt`（從該來源**逐字複製**、支撐 claim 的原文，≤300 字，不得改寫或翻譯）、`excerpt_from`（`snippet`＝搜尋摘要／`page`＝WebFetch 讀到的頁面）。`claim` 是你對原文的精簡轉述；`excerpt` 是證據本身。找不到可逐字複製的原文就填 null，不要自己寫一句當原文。

## 程式已抓好的一手文件摘錄（本軸）
以下為程式抓取的一手文件摘錄，可直接逐字引用（附 url 與 as_of）：
- 引用時 finding 的 `url`、`as_of` 照該則標示填；`source` 寫「來源＋文件」；`excerpt` 從「<<<」「>>>」之間**逐字複製**（≤300 字，取最能支撐 claim 的連續一段，不改寫、不翻譯）；`excerpt_from` 填 `"page"`。
- 一手清單顯示沒有某類事件時（例如「標題含關鍵字者 0 則」），可據此寫一條「經查一手紀錄無此類事件」的 finding（status=found、direction=`"0"`），excerpt 用清單本身那一句統計；不要因為沒找到事件就標 none。
- 這些摘錄不算你的搜尋：`queries_run` 只記你自己實際下過的搜尋；摘錄仍可另外搜尋補充，但不必為了湊證據重搜摘錄已涵蓋的內容。
- 摘錄與本軸問題無關或不足以回答時，照常搜尋；仍查不到才記 none。

Competition and Market Demand The industries and geographic markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and several of our competitors are large companies that have significant financial, technical and marketing resources. In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into some of the industries in which we operate and, as a result, organizations that have adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor. Furthermore, companies that we engage as subcontractors, including pursuant to certain regulatory and customer requirements, may develop the expertise necessary to compete with us with respect to the award of prime contracts from our customers.

A significant portion of our revenues is currently derived from unit price or fixed price agreements, and price is often an important factor in the award of such agreements. Accordingly, we could be underbid by our competitors. However, customers often consider other factors in choosing a service provider, including technical expertise and experience, breadth of solutions offerings, safety ratings, financial and operational resources, geographic presence, industry reputation and dependability, which we expect to benefit larger service providers such as us. In addition, competition may lessen as industry resources, such as labor supplies, approach capacity. There can be no assurance, however, that our competitors will not develop the expertise, 9 experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services, or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. The in-house service organizations of certain of our existing or prospective customers, primarily our utility customers, employ personnel who perform some of the same types of services we provide. Although these companies currently outsource a significant portion of these services, there can be no assurance that they will continue to do so in the future or that they will not acquire additional in-house capabilities.

Additionally, we also generally require that key management and former principals of the businesses we acquire agree to non-compete covenants in the purchase agreement or, as applicable, employment agreements. Enforceability of these non-competition agreements varies by jurisdiction and typically is dependent upon specific facts and circumstances, making it difficult to predict their enforceability. Therefore, if a member of the key management of the business we acquire is terminated, we might be subject to increased competition if the restrictive covenants entered into by such person are not enforceable or have expired, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We cannot be certain that we will maintain or enhance our competitive position or maintain our current customer base. Our industries are served by numerous companies, from small, owner-operated private companies to large multi-national, public companies. Relatively few barriers prevent entry into some areas of our business, and as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become one of our competitors. In addition, some of our competitors have significant financial, technical and marketing resources, and may have or develop expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services. Certain of our competitors may also have lower overhead cost structures, and therefore may be able to provide services at lower rates than us.

Furthermore, a substantial portion of our revenues is directly or indirectly dependent upon obtaining new contracts, which is unpredictable and often involves complex and lengthy negotiations and bidding processes that are impacted by a wide variety of factors, including, among other things, price, governmental approvals, financing contingencies, commodity prices, environmental conditions, overall market and economic conditions, and a potential customer’s perception of our ability to perform the work or the technological advantages held by our competitors. The competitive environment we operate in can also 30 affect the timing of contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts. For example, based on rapidly changing competition and market dynamics, we have recently experienced, and may in the future experience, more competitive pricing for smaller scale projects. Additionally, changing competitive pressures present difficulties in matching workforce size with available contract awards. As a result of the factors described above, the competitive environment we operate in can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

```

`clues` 選填、每軸一個陣列，沒有就整個欄位省略。只在你**找到有網址的線索、但沒讀到頁面而拿不到可逐字複製的原文**時放；程式會打開該網址，在全文裡找 `match_terms` 同時出現的一段原文，找到就升級成帶原文的 finding；找不到（或頁面打不開）就照 `excerpt_from: "snippet"`、`excerpt: null` 的 finding 保留，並標為未核原文。
- 只有 clues、findings 是空的時，`status` 填 `none`（程式核實到原文後會自動改成 `found`）。
- `url` 必須是你在搜尋結果裡實際看到的網址；不得編造、不得猜網址、不得填網站首頁。沒有網址的線索不要放（寫進 note）。已經寫在 findings 的網址不要重複放。
- `match_terms` 放 2～5 個預期原文會逐字出現的字串：金額、比例、專有名詞、引號裡的關鍵詞。照原文可能的寫法填，不要改寫或翻譯；不要放公司名、代號、年份或「營收」「公司」這類到處都有的詞。
- 其餘欄位（`claim`、`source`、`as_of`、`direction`、`affects`）規則同 findings；`as_of` 填你推估的文章發布日，程式讀到頁面發布日會以頁面為準。

寫入路徑：`/Users/ivanchang/financial-analysis-bot/.dd_build/runs/PWR_20261103/parts/axes_1.json`（用 Write 工具寫一次，不要分次 Edit）。

## 輪次紀律
你只有 WebSearch、WebFetch、Write 三個工具，沒有 Bash。**寫完 part 檔就停止**，不要自己驗證、不要重讀、不要回報長文。驗證由程式做；缺欄程式會把該軸記成缺口，不會叫你重寫。
搜尋：本軸最多 4 次；WebFetch 只在搜尋摘要不足以寫出 as_of 與 claim 時才用，每軸最多 2 次。

回報 ≤50 字：完成幾軸、found/none 各幾軸。
